					<h2>What is Item Response Theory?</h2>
					<section>
						<br><br>
						<h3>And now for a bit of math...</h3>
						<div>
							<p>$$Pr(Y_{ij} = 1 | a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i, \theta_j) = c_i + (d_i - c_i)\frac{exp^{(\alpha(\theta_j-\beta_i) ) }}{1 + exp^{(\alpha(\theta_j-\beta_i) ) }}$$</p>
							<ul>
								<li>$\alpha$ is the "discrimination" parameter</li>
								<li>$\beta$ is the "difficulty" parameter</li>
								<li>$c$ is the "pseudoguessing" parameter</li>
								<li>$d$ is the upper asymptote or highest probability of a correct response</li>
								<li>$\theta$ is the "ability" parameter</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>$\alpha$ quantifies how well the item does at identifying low vs high ability</li>
								<li>$\beta$ quantifies the amount of ability needed to have a 50% chance of responding correctly purely by chance</li>
								<li>$c$ quantifies the minimum probability of a correct response</li>
								<li>$\theta$ quantifies skill/ability...this gets transformed into a "scaled score"</li>
								<li>If we constrain $\alpha$ to 1, $c$ to 0, and $d$ to 1 we would be fitting a Rasch model to the data</li>
								<li>If we constrain $\alpha$ to be equal across items, $c$ to 0, and $d$ to 1 we would be fitting a 1 Parameter Logistic (1PL) model to the data</li>
								<li>If we constrain $c$ to 0 and $d$ to 1 we would be fitting a 2 Parameter Logistic Model (2PL) to the data</li>
								<li>If we constrain $d$ to 1 and freely estimate all other parameters we would be fitting a 3 Parameter Logistic Model (3PL) to the data</li>
								<li>If we freely estimate all parameters we would be fitting a 4 Parameter Logistic Model (4PL) to the data</li>
							</ul>

						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<br><br>
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li>Do to time contraints, we'll only talk about one of the ways to estimate 1PL models.</li>
								<li>More specifically, we'll be talking about fitting a Rasch model using the Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimator (JMLE) to the data.</li>
								<li>However, for those interested, if you view the slides and click your down arrow, there are some brief explanations of other IRT models that are appropriate for other contexts.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>There is quite a bit that we'll skip over, but the information is in the slides</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<br><br>
						<h3>Partial Credit Models (PCM)</h3>
						<div>
							<p>
								$$Pr(Y_{ij} = k | \theta_j) = \frac{exp^{ (\Sigma_{t=1}^k\alpha(\theta_j-\beta_{it}) ) }}{1 + \Sigma_{s = 1}^K exp^{ (\Sigma_{s=1}^s\alpha(\theta_j-\beta_{it}) ) } }  $$
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The $\alpha$ & $\theta$ parameters have the same meeting as the had from the other models.</li>
								<li>The $\beta$ parameter is the difficulty associated with the $t^{th}$ response option on the $i^{th}$ item</li>
								<li>The difference is that here we are predicting the probability of the respondent selecting the $k^{th}$ option from the response set if they have an ability of $\theta_j$</li>
								<li>$\theta$ is also assumed to be $N(0, 1)$</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>The $N(0, 1)$ part just means that $\theta$ is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1</li>
								<li>This model is used when you are using polytomous items, and reduces to the 1PL model if used with binary items</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<br><br>
						<h3>Rating Scale Models (RSM)</h3>
						<div>
							<p>
								$$Pr(Y_{ij} = k | \alpha, \beta_i, \theta_j) = \frac{exp^{ (\Sigma_{t=1}^k\alpha(\theta_j-\beta_{it}) ) }}{1 + \Sigma_{s = 1}^K exp^{ (\Sigma_{s=1}^s\alpha(\theta_j-\beta_{it}) ) } }  $$
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>There are some subtle but important differences between the Rating Scale and Partial Credit Models</li>
								<li>The distance between the category difficulties are also constrained to be equal (e.g., the difference between scoring a 3 or 4 is the same as the difference in scoring a 2 or 3)</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Ordinal data does not require there to be equal distance between the values.  Think of it like the order in which marathon runners finish.</li>
								<li>There is no reason to believe that the difference between the 1st and 2nd place finisher is the same as the difference between the 99th and 100th finisher</li>
								<li>This constraint is important to consider since it requires some fairly strong assumptions about the nature of the response scale and how respondents interpret it.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<br><br>
						<h3>Graded Response Models (GRM)</h3>
						<div>
							<p>
								$$Pr(Y_{ij} \geq k | \theta_j) = \frac{exp^{ (\Sigma_{t=1}^k\alpha_i(\theta_j-\beta_{ik}) ) }}{1 + \Sigma_{s = 1}^K exp^{ (\Sigma_{s=1}^s\alpha_i(\theta_j-\beta_{ik}) ) } }  $$
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Here the interpretation of the $\beta$ parameter changes to indicate the difficulty of endorsing category $k$ or higher for the $i^{th}$ item</li>
								<li>Additionally, unlike the PCM, the item discriminations (i.e., the $\alpha$) parameters are freely estimated</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Here there is an additional constraint related to the way difficulty is estimated.</li>
								<li>Unlike pairwise comparison of adjacent categories (e.g., 1 vs 2, 2 vs 3, etc...) this is a comparison of an higher values to a baseline (e.g., 1 vs 2, 3, or 4, 2 vs 3 or 4, 3 vs 4).</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<br><br>
						<h3>Nominal Response Models (NRM)</h3>
						<div>
							<p>
								$$Pr(Y_{ij} = k | \theta_j) = \frac{exp^{ (\alpha_{ik}(\theta_j-\beta_{ik}) ) }}{\Sigma_{h = 1}^K exp^{ (\alpha_{ih}(\theta_j-\beta_{ih}) ) } }  $$
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>You can think of this as the categorical analog to the GRM.</li>
								<li>These models would be used in cases where the response choice has no inherent value that could be ordered (e.g., what is your favorite ice cream flavor?)</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>This is unlikely to be used in an assessment related to skill, mastery, or ability, but is valuable when creating surveys related to preference for different options.</li>
								<li>For example, if you wanted to analyze a survey about which programs students would prefer to participate in, you would likely use this type of model.</li>

						<h2><a href="http://itemanalysis.com/jmetrik-download.php">Get jMetrik Here</a></h2>
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li>Java-based application for Psychometric analysis of data</li>
								<li>Freely available (e.g., does not cost you anything to use it and you can even modify it if you so desire)</li>
								<li>Some functionality has been integrated into other software platforms like Stata (the <a href="https://wbuchanan.github.io/StatajMetrik/raschjmle/">raschjmle</a> program)</li>
								<li>The source code for all of the <a href="https://github.com/meyerjp3/psychometrics">math</a> and <a href="https://github.com/meyerjp3/jmetrik">user interface</a> is publicly available: </li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>There are other programs like IRTPRO, BILOG, MULTILOG, Xcaliber, WinSteps, Facets, etc... used by testing companies that vary in cost</li>
								<li>This gets you comparable results (there will be some slight differences but shouldn't be anything that substantial) across the tools, but without the cost</li>
								<li>jMetrik also includes functionality for doing IRT true score equating, linking, and other functionality related to developing multiple forms of a single measure</li>
								<li>There are also several different scaling procedures available in the platform that help you to generate scaled scores that might be more palatteable and easier to explain than values of theta</li>

						<h3>HR Issues</h3>
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li><a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/401/424.html">Griggs v Duke Power Co (1971)</a> restricts the use of assessments for hiring to only those which are "demonstrably a reasonable measure of job performance".</li>
								<li><a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/487/977.html">Watson v Fort Worth Bank & Trust (1988)</a> sets a clear need to have statistical evidence for use of assessment in hiring/firing decisions</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Griggs v Duke Power</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Nothing in the Act precludes the use of testing or measuring procedures; obviously they are useful. What Congress has forbidden is giving these devices and mechanisms controlling force unless they are demonstrably a reasonable measure of job performance</li>
									<li>What Congress has commanded is that any tests used must measure the person for the job and not the person in the abstract.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Watson v Fort Worth</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Since neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals has evaluated the statistical evidence to determine whether petitioner made out a prima facie case of discrimination under disparate impact theory, the case must be remanded.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>If you are using locally developed assessments as part of your evaluation system, you need to do your due dilligence to show that it is a sound measure for inferences about educator quality/effectiveness</li>

						<h3>The Real Reason</h3>
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li>Bad Measurement = Bad Decisions = Bad Outcomes</li>
								<li>We should enable the adults working with children to make the best decisions based on the best possible data.</li>
								<li>Bad Measurement + Correct Decision = Bad Decisions = Bad Outcomes</li>
								<li>The quality of your measurement <strong style="color:#000000">is empirical, not opinion or feeling.</strong></li>
								<li><strong style="color:#000000">Just because you think you are measuring something doesn't mean you are measuring it.</strong></li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>You wouldn't try to claim how good a song was if you could only barely hear the song through all the static, so why are we ok making similar claims and statements about children and the adults teaching them?</li>
								<li>If anyone is telling educators to change their day to day practices based on measures with unknown properties...STOP!!!!!</li>
								<li>If you don't know the measurement you have is not good, you may make the correct/best decision based on what you take to be highly reliable error free data.  But, even in those cases the best decision based on noisy data is still generally the wrong decision, and will lead to the wrong outcome.</li>
								<li>The better you know your measurement, the better you understand how to interpret the data derived from it.</li>

							<ul>
								<li>Rasch models constrain discrimination to be equal to a value of 1</li>
								<li>Only the difficulty parameter is freely estimated</li>
								<li>This can only be used with unidimensional measures (e.g., one subject/topic/content area)</li>
								<li>When the item parameters are unknown a priori, use the Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimator (JMLE)</li>
								<li>The JMLE allows you to calibrate the items and estimate the person parameters simultaneously</li>
								<li>If you know the item parameter values a priori you can use the Marginal Maximum Likelihood (MML) Estimator for the item calibrations or person parameter estimates</li>
								<li>When you don't have many observations, the Rasch models require the least amount of data to generate stable estimates of the parameters and may be less succeptable to parameter drift</li>

								<li>The item information function shows the level of skill, mastery, or ability at which a correct response gives us the most information about the test taker</li>
								<li>Items that are too easy or too difficult for the student give us little to no information about the student's underlying skill, mastery, or ability</li>
								<li>But there is a sweet spot where we can learn a good amount about the students.</li>
								<li>When constructing a test the importance of the information function cannot be understated and should align with the purpose of the assessment</li>
								<li>You can measure the same concept with items of varying difficulty, so if you can match the difficulty of the items with the skill, mastery, or ability of the test takers you can glean more information from the results</li>
								<li>When you create the test/form try to select items that provide a good amount of information across the range of theta that the test takers are assumed to have</li>
								<li>For diagnostic assessments, you'll typically want to focus on the left tail of theta to get items that are more appropriate for struggling students</li>

								<li>These are items where the students with greater skill, mastery, or ability are less likely to answer correctly than students with lower levels of skill, mastery, or ability</li>
								<li>You can get items like this if the wording causes students with different levels of ability, skill, or mastery to interpret the item stem inconsistently</li>

							<ul>
								<li>The test characteristic curve/test information function is analogous to the ICC/IIF, but summarizes things for the test as a whole</li>
								<li>This gives you an idea about how well all the items function collectively as a unified test/measure</li>
								<li>The standard error of measurement should not be overlooked.</li>
								<li>Remember that all of statistics is about uncertainty; In other words, nothing is certain in statistics other than estimates contain some degree of uncertainty</li>
								<li>As you get into the tails of the ability distribution there will be more error/noise in the measurement</li>
								<li>Aside from being how the math works, this is also due to the number of students that are usually in the tails of the distribution</li>

								<li>The discrimination parameter does not mean human discrimination</li>
								<li>You could think of it like how well Kentuckians can detect good from bad basketball players (e.g., discriminating taste in basketball players), particularly those who view basketball through blue and white lenses</li>
								<li>This is basically about the range over which the item does a good job at identifying high and low skill, mastery, and ability</li>
								<li>The slope should always be positive when using an item in a test form</li>
								<li>For a Rasch model, this slope will always be equal to 1</li>
								<li>For other types of 1PL models, the slope will be equal to the average item discrimination</li>
								<li>In 2PL, 3PL, and 4PL models, the slope can and will vary by item</li>

							<ul>
								<li>Differential Item Functioning is a way to evaluate measurement invariance at the item level</li>
								<li>If a reading passage tells a story about Rugby, we would expect students from New Zealand with the same ability as American students would have a greater probability of answering correctly.  This is what DIF is.</li>
								<li>DIF does not mean bias.  Bias occurs when a group of students has a lower chance of answering correctly regardless of their ability.</li>
								<li>DIF analysis is a way of flagging items for additional review.</li>
								<li>There is also differential test functioning, but that is closer to traditional tests of measurement invariance from the structural equation modeling literature</li>
								<li>What we want at the end of the day is for any differences in the latent means (e.g., theta, skill, ability, mastery, etc...) to be true differences and not be driven by differences in the probabilities of correct responses across groups with the same/similar levels of ability.</li>
